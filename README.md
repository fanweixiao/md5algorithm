# md5algorithm

MD5 algorithm explained online step by step visually https://md5algorithm.vercel.app/
This website will help you understand how a md5 hash is calculated from start to finish.

This project is inspired by [sha256algorithm](https://github.com/dmarman/sha256algorithm), but focuses on MD5 with a cleaner code structure and step-by-step round tracing.
